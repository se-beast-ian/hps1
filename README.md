### HPS1

A collection of solemn utterances ancestring to Captain Haddock (<a href="https://www.tintin.com/">Tin Tin<a/>)  ... conveniently packaged as your bash shell prompt.

### Which style?
  
  Code fails to compile: <b>Thousands of thundering typhoons! </b> <br>
  Program crashes: <b> Millions and billions of blue blistering barnacles </b> <br>
