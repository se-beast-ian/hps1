### HPS1

A collection of solemn utterances ancestring to Captain Haddock (<a href="https://www.tintin.com/">Tin Tin<a/>)  ... conveniently packaged as your bash shell prompt. <br>
So convenient in fact, that it will change on each prompt. This way when something doesn't work right, you have a course word ready! 

### Why the need for this

Computer code and cursing are intricately related and inseparable, especially when things go wrong. Not if, when. Cursing is frowned upon - in the best of cases - 
so why not do it in style ? 
  
### Which style?
  
  Code fails to compile? <b>Thousands of thundering typhoons! </b> <br>
  Program crashes? <b> Millions and billions of blue blistering barnacles </b> <br>
  rm -rvf / as sudo? <b> Dictatorial duck-billed diplodocus </b> 
  
  
### Installation 

  <ul>
    <li> Clone the repository and copy <b>haddocks.sh</b> and <b>haddocks.txt</b> into your home directory </li>
    <li> Copy/Paste <b>if [ -f ~/haddocks.sh ]; then PS1='$(~/haddocks.sh)' fi</b> into your ~/.bashrc config</li>
  </ul>
  
  
### Enjoy
